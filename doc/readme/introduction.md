Lightweight, modular DOM library.

Browser targets are relatively *modern browsers* from IE9+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and modern versions of Opera (post [blink][] integration).

This library is not designed to be a drop-in replacement for [jquery][], it is designed to provide a modular library that is *jqueryesque* therefore it is best suited to new projects.

***Work in progress: not yet ready for production***
